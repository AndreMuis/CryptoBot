# CryptoBot

Crypto bot for macOS

Uses the ByBit API.

Invests a fixed amount into every coin on ByBit and converts any increase greater than the minimum trade amount for that coin to USDT.

You will have to install OpenSSL separately for security reasons.

Add your SMTP server settings on the Settings tab to receive emails from the bot.
